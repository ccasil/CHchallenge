# CruzHacks Organizer Technical Challenges

Thank you for putting forth your candidacy for the CruzHacks 2020 organizing team. We're excited by the possibility of working with you! Our team will go through applications after the March 8th deadline and notify you as soon as possible.

## Purpose

If you applied for the software development or design teams, you are required to fulfill an additional technical challenge. The purpose of these challenges is to asses your technical skills and give you a preview of the type of projects you might be working on as a part of our team.

There are a number of traits we look for in candidate developers and designers. We don't expect all candidates to be experienced professionals - far from it. Qualities that make a successful organizer that supersede technical skills include empathy, teamwork, communication, and accountability.

These traits are difficult to discern from a technical challenge. Thus while high performance on coding challenges will help your application, other factors will be taken into account.

## Submissions

Developer candidates can submit either of the coding challenges or both. Design candidates are required to fill the design challenge. If you're a candidate for both teams, you must submit both challenges.

You must email **contact@cruzhacks.com** a link to the Github repo for your project by March 15th (11.59 PM). Included in the repo's README.md file should be simple instructions on how to run your project. The email's subject line should read **CruzHacks Challenge - Last, First**.
